# Quantify NYC 



This is an ongoing passion project where I take various different data sets pertaining to NYC and create visualizations. 


<b>Projects:</b>

Covid_Data - Find correlation with NYC vaccine and case rate, correlation between rate of first and second vaccine being administered, plotted multi- series line chart to display shift/pattern of case rate and vaccination rate of dose 1 & 2 over a period of time. 

Subway_Data - Extracting frequency values of NYC subway entrances per train line and creating visualizations with percentages.

MONKEY_POX_NYC - Using NYC Monkey Pox data to visualize case rate over time. As well as comparing current NYC Monkey Pox data to the beginning stages of COVID.
