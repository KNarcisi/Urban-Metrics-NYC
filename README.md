<p align="center"><i>Urban Metrics NYC is a dynamic repository and ongoing passion project that combines my expertise as a former student studying biomedical informatics with my current role at a renewable energy development company involved in city planning and policy. It embodies my commitment to leveraging interdisciplinary knowledge and data-driven insights to generate positive change in urban environments. Serving as a platform for exploring the quantitative landscape of urban living, Urban Metrics NYC sheds light on crucial challenges and opportunities faced by cities. Through this project, I strive to uncover valuable insights that inform evidence-based strategies, empower decision-makers, and contribute to building healthier, more sustainable, and equitable cities for all.</i></p>
